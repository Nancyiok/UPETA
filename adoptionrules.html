        <span id ="r">Animals are not given away without first passing an interview and agreeing the date and time of arrival with the adoption manager/director of the shelter. To do this, call +38 096 935 59 15, if you want to take a cat or a dog.</span><br>
        <span id="r">The interview is a mandatory stage of adoption. The manager will ask you questions, the answers to which will help to understand your readiness for the appearance of a new family member, help with the choice of a four-legged friend, and provide advice on care.</span><br>
        <span  id="r">The manager has the right to refuse the adoption if he considers that there are objective grounds for this. The tails should go to responsible people who are ready to provide comfortable and safe conditions for their maintenance.</span><br>
        <span  id="r">Please note that the interview may take up to 30 minutes. Please call in advance to choose a convenient time for the conversation. The adoption manager is available from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br>
        <span  id="r">You can choose a friend by reviewing the questionnaires on the website, or consult with the manager.</span><br>
        <span  id="r">We must conclude an agreement on the transfer of the animal with everyone. The manager can send the contract for preliminary review.</span><br>
